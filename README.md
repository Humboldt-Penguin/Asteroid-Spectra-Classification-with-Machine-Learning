# Asteroid Spectra Classification with Machine Learning

Will upload by 2/12/22 -- my old laptop got fried, so I need to pull out the SSD.

This data science and machine learning project is about classifying asteroid taxonomy spectra. We use over 1,000 spectra from to train miscellaneous models to e.g., distinguish between the X class and non X class, and to perform multi-label classification and unsupervised clustering using autoencoders.
